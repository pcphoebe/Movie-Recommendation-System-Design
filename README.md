# Movie Recommendation System Design

**Description**

This was a group project on utilizing data infrastructures and databases. The project designs a Data Lake and uses Cassandra database that would be used to create the system. While the system was not implemented, the system was carefully designed based on comparisons of various data infrastructure and databases. Public datasets, including Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews and New York Times movie reviews API, were found and would be utilized in this system.

New York Times movie reviews API: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview
